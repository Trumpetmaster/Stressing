# Lets give our anime character some idenity!

**Properties and Behaviors!**

Firstly, we are going to create an object, or body, for our person. Objects are made up of two key things which 
are properties and behaviours. Properties are what the object has. For example, a phone has a battary, a screen,
some bottons, and some other stuff. Bheaviours are the action the phone carries out.They are essentially 
functions or otherwise known as methods. For expample, the phone can turn on, go on the internet, play music,
games, videos, etc. Think of an object as play doe. It has many forms and can be shaped into anything. 
To create one, you can simply do:

var myObject = {};

We are assigning the variable my object to an empty object. Objects are represented with curly brackets, or 
braces. So when we use = {}, we're saying, equals an empty Object. This is an object literal. 


**TODO 1 :** Lets make an object. Go to TODO 1.


```javascript
#!/usr/bin/env node

// TODO 1 : create variables for prompt and fs by calling require in each respective module:
var person = {};
console.log(person);

```
Alright, save and then run the app!


**Run the App** Switch to the command line, and go ahead and run the app like so:
And this is how you put a box around your text:

    # ./my-lesson.js
